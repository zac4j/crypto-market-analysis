# Cryptocurrency Market Analysis with Machine Learning Methods

This repository explores various machine learning models for analysis cryptocurrency market, the tasks such as predicting coin price, grouping similar behavior coins, analysis social sentiment, etc.

## Project Overview

* The project utilizes top cryptocurrencies historical data to train and test the models.
* The code is written in Python (specify libraries used like pandas, scikit-learn) in Jupyter Notebook.
* Empoly **Supervised learning** models (e.g., Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines) to predict Bitcoin prices.
* Leverage **unsupervised learning** models (e.g., K-Means clustering) to identify patterns or insights from the data.

## Implementation

- Completed
  - [Predicting Bitcoin Price with Supervised Learning Methods](https://github.com/zac4j/btc-price-prediction)
  - Cryptocurrency Market Analysis with Unsupervised Learning Methods
- TBD
  - Cryptocurrency Market Analysis with Deep Learning Methods

## Future Work

* Exploration of **deep learning** architectures (e.g., LSTMs) for time series forecasting.
* Performance comparison of different models.
* Integration of additional features that might influence price (e.g., social sentiment).
