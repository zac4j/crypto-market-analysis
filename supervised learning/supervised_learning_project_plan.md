# Plan for BTC Price Prediction with Linear Regression and SVM

1. **Data Collection**:

   - Identify the cryptocurrency you want to predict the price for cryptocurrency.
   - Collect historical price data for the selected cryptocurrency from the CoinGecko API.
   - Gather relevant features that might influence the cryptocurrency price (e.g., trading volume, market capitalization, sentiment analysis from social media, etc.).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Handle missing data by either removing or imputing missing values.
   - Convert the date/time column into a suitable format for analysis.
   - Scale or normalize the features if necessary, as linear regression assumes that the features are on a similar scale.

3. **Feature Engineering**:

   - Create new features from the existing ones if you think they might improve the model's performance (e.g., moving averages, price momentum, volatility indicators).
   - Encode categorical features (if any) using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

4. **Train-Test Split**:

   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training, 20% for testing).

5. **Models**:

   - Import the necessary libraries (e.g., `sklearn.linear_model`, `sklearn.svm`, `sklearn.model_selection`, `sklearn.metrics`).
   - Create an instance of the `LinearRegression` class from `sklearn.linear_model`.
   - Create an instance of the `SVR` class from `sklearn.svm`
   - Fit the models to the training data using the `fit` method.

6. **Model Evaluation**:

   - Make predictions on the test data using the `predict` method.
   - Calculate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared (RÂ²) to assess the model's performance.

7. **Model Tuning (Optional)**:

   - If the model's performance is not satisfactory, you can try different feature engineering techniques, feature selection methods, or regularization techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to make predictions on new data.
   - Remember to update the model regularly with new data as the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile.
